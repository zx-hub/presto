======================
Command Line Interface
======================

The Presto CLI provides a terminal-based, interactive shell for running
queries. The CLI is a
`self-executing <http://skife.org/java/unix/2011/06/20/really_executable_jars.html>`_
JAR file, which means it acts like a normal UNIX executable.

Requirements
------------

The CLI requires a Java virtual machine available on the path.
It can be used with Java version 8 and higher.

Installation
------------

Download :maven_download:`cli`, rename it to ``presto``,
make it executable with ``chmod +x``, then run it:

.. code-block:: none

    ./presto --server localhost:8080 --catalog hive --schema default

Run the CLI with the ``--help`` option to see the available options.

Authentication
--------------

You can override your username with the ``--user`` option. It defaults to your
operating system username. If your Presto server requires password
authentication, use the ``--password`` option to have the CLI prompt for a
password. You can set the ``PRESTO_PASSWORD`` environment variable with the
password value to avoid the prompt.

Use ``--help`` to see information about specifying the keystore, truststore, and
other authentication details as required. If using Kerberos, see :doc:`/security/cli`.

Pagination
----------

By default, the results of queries are paginated using the ``less`` program
which is configured with a carefully selected set of options. This behavior
can be overridden by setting the environment variable ``PRESTO_PAGER`` to the
name of a different program such as ``more`` or `pspg <https://github.com/okbob/pspg>`_,
or it can be set to an empty value to completely disable pagination.
