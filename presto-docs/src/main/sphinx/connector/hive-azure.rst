=================================
Hive Connector with Azure Storage
=================================

The :doc:`hive` can be configured to query
Azure Standard Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ABFS). Azure Blobs
are accessed via the Windows Azure Storage Blob (WASB). This layer is built on
top of the HDFS APIs and is what allows for the separation of storage from the
cluster.

Presto supports both ADLS Gen1 and Gen2. With ADLS Gen2 now generally available,
we recommend using ADLS Gen2. Learn more from `the official documentation
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-overview>`_.

Hive Connector Configuration
----------------------------

All configuration for the Azure storage driver is stored in the Hadoop
``core-site.xml`` configuration file. The path to the file needs to be
configured in the the catalog properties file:

.. code-block:: none

    hive.config.resources=<path_to_hadoop_core-site.xml>

Configuration for Azure Storage credentials
-------------------------------------------

If you do not want to rely on Hadoop's ``core-site.xml`` and want to have Presto
configured independently with the storage credentials, you can use the following
properties in the catalog configuration.

We suggest to use this kind of configuration when you only have the Primary
Storage account linked to the cluster. When there are secondary storage accounts
involved, it is recommended to configure Presto using
``hive.config.resources=<path_to_hadoop_core-site.xml>``, provided
``core-site.xml`` has the all storage account credentials.

  * - ``hive.azure.wasb-storage-account``
    - Storage account name of Azure Blob Storage
  * - ``hive.azure.wasb-access-key``
    - The decrypted access key for the Azure Blob Storage

If you choose to use ADLS Gen2, you need to add the following properties:

    - Storage account name of Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
  * - ``hive.azure.abfs-access-key``
    - The decrypted access key for the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2ÃŸ

While it is advised to migrate to ADLS Gen2 whenever possible, if you still
choose to use ADLS Gen1 you need to add the following properties.

.. note::

    Credentials for the filesystem can be configured using ``ClientCredential``
    type. To authenticate with ADLS Gen1 you must create a new application
    secret for your ADLS Gen1 account's App Registration, and save this value
    because you won't able to retrieve the key later. Refer to the Azure
    `documentation
    <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-service-to-service-authenticate-using-active-directory>`_
    for details.

Accessing Azure Storage data
----------------------------

URI scheme to reference data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consistent with other FileSystem implementations within Hadoop, the Azure
Standard Blob and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ABFS) drivers define their own
URI scheme so that resources (directories and files) may be distinctly
addressed. You can access both primary and secondary storage accounts linked to
the cluster with the same URI scheme. Following are example URIs for the
different systems.

ABFS URI:

.. code-block:: none

    abfs[s]://file_system@account_name.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>/<path>/<file_name>

ADLS Gen1 URI:

.. code-block:: none

    adl://<data_lake_storage_gen1_name>.azuredatalakestore.net/<path>/<file_name>

Azure Standard Blob URI:

.. code-block:: none

    wasb[s]://container@account_name.blob.core.windows.net/<path>/<path>/<file_name>

Querying Azure Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can query tables already configured in your Hive metastore used in your Hive
catalog. To access Azure Storage data that is not yet mapped in the Hive
metastore, you need to provide the schema of the data, the file format, and the
data location.

For example, if you have ORC or Parquet files in an ABFS ``file_system``, you
need to execute a query::

    -- select schema in which the table is to be defined, must already exist
    USE hive.default;

    -- create table
    CREATE TABLE orders (
         orderkey bigint,
         custkey bigint,
         orderstatus varchar(1),
         totalprice double,
         orderdate date,
         orderpriority varchar(15),
         clerk varchar(15),
         shippriority integer,
         comment varchar(79)
    ) WITH (
         external_location = 'abfs[s]://file_system@account_name.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>/<path>/<file_name>`',
         format = 'ORC' -- or 'PARQUET'
    );

Now you can query the newly mapped table::

    SELECT * FROM orders;

Writing data
------------

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you attempt to write data to Azure Storage, make sure you have configured
everything necessary to read data from the storage.

Create a write schema
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the Hive metastore contains schema(s) mapped to Azure storage filesystems,
you can use them to write data to Azure storage.

If you don't want to use existing schemas, or there are no appropriate schemas
in the Hive metastore, you need to create a new one::

    CREATE SCHEMA hive.abfs_export
    WITH (location = 'abfs[s]://file_system@account_name.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>');

Write data to Azure Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have a schema pointing to a location where you want to write the data,
you can issue a ``CREATE TABLE AS`` statement and select your desired file
format. The data will be written to one or more files within the
``abfs[s]://file_system@account_name.dfs.core.windows.net/<path>/my_table``
namespace. Example::

    CREATE TABLE hive.abfs_export.orders_abfs
    WITH (format = 'ORC')
    AS SELECT * FROM tpch.sf1.orders;
